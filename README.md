## project description
Description of the final plan: The Weather Recording App allows users to manage weather station information. Users can add, edit, and delete weather stations. The app also provides real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API based on latitude and longitude coordinates.
Features included:
release 1
Add Weather Station:
Users can add edit and delete new weather stations by providing relevant details (e.g., station name, location, elevation).
release 2
Add, edit and delete weather report to each station containing weather parameters: Code (weather code), Temp (Temperature), wind Speed, WInd Direction Pressure.

weather code map:
weather code >=200 and weather code <299 weather code = "thunderstrom"; 

weather code >=300 and weather code <499 
weather code = "drizzle"; 

weather code >=500 and weather code <599 
weather code = "rain";

weather code >=600 and weather code <699 weather code = "snow";

weather code >=700 and weather code <799 weather code = "haze";

weather code =800 = "sunny";   

else weather code = "cloudy";

release 3
Maximum and minimum of each parameter could be evaluatedif required other data manipulation such as average could be applied.

# Weather station Proof of Concept (POC) baseline

This proof of concept (POC) demonstrates the functionality of a weather station app according to the provided specifications of each release (1 - 4). The app is designed to displayed recorded parameters of weather station in different location. It is based on module concept of software development in the Escape framework with Node.js.


## Features
release 1
Add Weather Station:
Users can add edit and delete new weather stations by providing relevant details (e.g., station name, location, elevation).
release 2
Add, edit and delete weather report to each station containing weather parameters: Code (weather code), Temp (Temperature), wind Speed, WInd Direction Pressure.

weather code map:
weather code >=200 and weather code <299 weather code = "thunderstrom"; 

weather code >=300 and weather code <499 
weather code = "drizzle"; 

weather code >=500 and weather code <599 
weather code = "rain";

weather code >=600 and weather code <699 weather code = "snow";

weather code >=700 and weather code <799 weather code = "haze";

weather code =800 = "sunny";   

else weather code = "cloudy";

release 3
Calculate and display maximum and minimum of each parameter could be evaluatedif required other data manipulation such as average could be applied .         



## installation

Web app will first be hosted in Github then the beta version wil be host with Netlify.  Web app could be access via most web browsers.

## Roadmap

- continues developing the dashboard to state 4: Add a report to a station with the parameter in the "Report" column



## Usage/Examples
This is a POC of a cloud based database application.
This app an example of cloud based database application manages weather station data. It allows users to store information about various weather stations, edit existing records, and perform data manipulation tasks.

Data Storage:
Users can store weather station records in the cloud database.
Each record includes details such as station name, location, elevation, and other relevant data.
Addition of Data:
Users can add new weather station records.
Input fields include station name, latitude, longitude, elevation, and any other relevant parameters.
Editing and Amending Data:
Existing records can be edited:
Change station name, location, or elevation.
Update other relevant data.
Users can amend data based on new measurements or corrections.
Data Manipulation:
Users can perform various operations on the data:
Calculate average temperature over a specific time period.
Identify stations with the highest rainfall.
Find the nearest weather station to a given location.
